# PhoneBook
PhoneBook allows the user to enter contacts into their personal phone book and see their details.

## Description
This is a small phone book project to practise MVVM with WPF and a first attempt at connecting my own C# code to a SQL database. With this application, the user can add contacts to a phone book which is stored in a table in a SQL Server database. The user can also take a look at their contacts as a table.
